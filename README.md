# TTS-GPT
This code implements a chatbot assistant that can transcribe user audio input, process it using OpenAI's GPT-3 API, and provide both verbal and text responses. The chatbot uses the ElevenLabs library to generate audio responses from the system message generated by GPT-3. The code is implemented using the Gradio library for creating user interfaces, allowing the assistant to be launched as a web application.
